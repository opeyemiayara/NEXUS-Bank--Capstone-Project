# Project Name: 
NEXUS Bank - Capstone Project
## Project Description:
Customer Segmentation and Deposit Detection System Case Study 
## Objective:
Due to the discussions at the recent board meeting, the objective of this case study is the need to improve efficiently and optimize the operations at Nexus bank. This will be achieved by gaining insights into the bank, leverage on the power of data and anticipate customer behavior.We will carry out tasks to identify patterns and trends in customer behavior to decipher if customer demographics such as age, educational level e.t.c influences customers attitude toward defaulting. The board specifically wants to anticipate future customer behavior and know the likelihood of subscription to term deposits from customers. We also want to understand how effective their campaigns are and thus develop marketing campaigns to reach specific customer segments. By analyzing customer behaviors, loan trends, and marketing campaign effectiveness, Nexus wants to optimize its operations, mitigate risks/ loan defaults, and improve customer subscription to term deposits.
### Methodology
The methodology used in this case study involves the following steps:
Data cleaning and preprocessing: The first step is to clean and preprocess the data, including handling missing values, removing outliers, and transforming variables as necessary. 
Exploratory data analysis: Next, we will perform exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the data, such as identifying trends and patterns, and identifying correlations between variables. 
Feature engineering: Based on the insights gained from the exploratory data analysis, we will perform feature engineering to select the most relevant features for predicting customer behavior and transform them as necessary. 
Model selection and training: We will then select a suitable machine learning algorithm for predicting customer behavior, such as linear regression or a decision tree, and train the model on the preprocessed data. 
Model evaluation and fine-tuning: We will evaluate the performance of the model using various metrics, such as mean absolute error and mean squared error, and fine-tune the model as necessary to improve its accuracy.
